<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It doesn't appear
	to contain any statistic analytical tool to analyze emails sent. 
	This may make it difficult to not know if it was successful or not.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It is confirmed to
	send to a large pool of recipients and the app may not be suitable
	for larger amounts of emails being sent.  However, the app is in
	development and it is possible that this will improve.  The problem
	is that it may take time for a larger pool to be possible.  However
	it depends on how many the department of records wants to send
	emails to.  It may be an option.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It is still in
	development and certain features are missing from it.  Templates may
	not be as update with the competition.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It doesn't appear
	to possess any statistical tools to keep track of whether emails
	were read or not.  It maybe harder for the NYC department of records
	to rely on for certain events.</P>
